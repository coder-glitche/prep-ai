Set up a clear communication workflow\n\nCreated a task board (Trello/Jira) for tracking deliverables.\n\nConducted short daily sync calls (10–12 mins) to understand blockers.\n\nEnsured that every module (vision, telemetry, navigation, UI) had a defined API contract.\n\n2.

Conflict resolution through data\n\nThere was a conflict between the vision team and flight-control team:\n\nVision team wanted higher resolution for better accuracy.\n\nFlight team needed lower resolution for real-time framerate.\n\nI resolved this by:\n\nRunning benchmark tests on the Jetson comparing FPS vs accuracy.\n\nSharing the results with both teams.\n\nProposing a balanced, hybrid solution —\nUse medium resolution for inference + downsampled feed for live streaming.\n\nBoth teams agreed because decisions were based on metrics, not opinions.\n\n4.
